# # Election Analysis

This repository contains a Python script to analyze election data and generate election results.

## Description

The script reads a CSV file containing election data, processes the data, and outputs the total number of votes cast, a complete list of candidates who received votes, the percentage and total number of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Files

- `election_analysis.py`: The main Python script to analyze the election data.
- `election_data.csv`: The dataset containing the election data with columns "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate".
- `README.md`: This readme file.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/election-analysis.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```sh
    cd election-analysis
    ```

3. **Ensure you have Python installed.** If not, download and install it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

1. **Place the `election_data.csv` file in the same directory as the `election_analysis.py` script.**

2. **Run the script:**

    ```s








    python election_analysis.py
    ```

3. **The script will output the election results to the terminal.** The output will include the total number of votes, the percentage and number of votes each candidate received, and the winner of the election.

## Example Output

# Financial Analysis

## Overview

This project involves a Python script designed to analyze financial records of a company. The script processes data from a CSV file named `budget_data.csv`, which contains monthly profit and loss information. The script computes various financial metrics to derive insights into the financial trends of the company.

## Data

The dataset `budget_data.csv` includes the following columns:
- `Date`: The month and year of the record.
- `Profit/Losses`: The net profit or loss for the month.

## Features

The script performs the following analyses:
- Calculates the total number of months covered in the dataset.
- Computes the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
- Analyzes the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period and calculates the average of these changes.
- Identifies the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
- Identifies the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

## Results

The results from the script will show:
- Total Months: Number of months in the dataset.
- Total: Total net amount of "Profit/Losses".
- Average Change: Average monthly change in "Profit/Losses".
- Greatest Increase in Profits: Date and amount of the highest increase in profits.
- Greatest Decrease in Profits: Date and amount of the highest decrease in profits.

## Usage

To run this script, you will need Python installed on your system. Place the script and the `budget_data.csv` file in the same directory, then execute the script using the following command:

```bash
python financial_analysis.py
